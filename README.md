# The Odin Project Foundations: Etch-a-Sketch Project

Live Preview: [Pixel Pusher](https://kidcalico.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/)

I made an Etch-A-Sketch like webpage using HTML, CSS and Javascript,
to fulfill the second to last project requirement for the Foundations
Course in [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). This was a
super fun way to test my skills and put to use what I have learned so
far in this course.

This was an excellent chance to test out my progress with functions, 
loops and CSS styling.

In further versions I would like to add a shader brush and an eraser.
